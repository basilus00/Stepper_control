# Stepper_control
this is repo for stepper_code
so in this code you'll find how to program you arduino car to modify stepper speed based on user command an how to reduce it when there is an obstacle in frnt of the ulrasonic sensor
arduino is equipped with lcd displayer to show speed and distance and display there is an obstacle if it exists within the threshold range as well as opening a led and a buzzer 
the speed reduces when there is an obstacle and the speed commend is from a remote control captured by an IR sensor
